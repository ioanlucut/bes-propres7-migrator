To get started with `bes-propres7-migrator`, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Clone this repository
and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ilucut/bes-propres7-migrator.git
cd bes-propres7-migrator

npm install
```

## Usage

### Expected Song Format

Your .txt song files should follow this specific markup format for successful conversion:

```
[title]
Your Song Title

[sequence]
1,c,2,c

### Running the Migrator locally

You can migrate your songs locally by following these steps:

1. Set up your environment variables according to your local setup:

```dotenv
# .env.local
TZ=Europe/Bucharest
# src-directory-with-txt-songs
LOCAL_SOURCE_DIR=../bes-lyrics/verified
# out-directory-with-pro-songs
LOCAL_OUT_DIR=./out_temp_for_local
CONNECT_TO_G_DRIVE=false

```

2. To convert your songs locally, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run convert:local
```

As a result, the migrator will convert all `.txt` song files from the specified source directory to `.pro` format in the
given directory, with the following format:

Under the `./out_temp_for_local`, and a dynamically created directory like `/2024-04-09-17:18:05`,
the `Aceasta mi-e dorinta sa Te-onorez.pro` will be generated.
Also, a `manifest.json` will be generated like e.g.:

```json
{
  "inventory": [
    {
      "id": "8ipLZddXG3Zy7Hbbo93Vm7",
      "fileName": "Aceasta mi-e dorinta sa Te-onorez.txt",
      "contentHash": "418384"
    }
  ],
  "updatedOn": "2024-04-09-17:18:05"
}
```

### Running the Migrator remotely

You can migrate your songs remotely to a Google Drive account by following these steps:

1. Set up your environment variables according to your local setup:

```dotenv
# .env.remote
TZ=Europe/Bucharest
# src-directory-with-txt-songs
LOCAL_SOURCE_DIR=../bes-lyrics/verified
GDRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID=id-of-your-folder-in-gdrive
CONNECT_TO_G_DRIVE=true
GDRIVE_BES_CLIENT_ID=taken-from-the-gdrive-app-config
GDRIVE_BES_CLIENT_SECRET=taken-from-the-gdrive-app-config
GDRIVE_BES_CLIENT_REFRESH_TOKEN=taken-from-the-gdrive-app-config
```

2. To convert your songs remotely, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run convert:remote
```

As a result, the migrator will convert all `.txt` song files from the specified source directory to `.pro` format in the
given directory, with the following format:

Under the given `GDRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID` and a dynamically created directory like `/2024-04-09-17:18:05`,
the `Aceasta mi-e dorinta sa Te-onorez.pro` will be generated and uploaded.
Also, a `manifest.json` will be generated:

```json
{
  "inventory": [
    {
      "id": "8ipLZddXG3Zy7Hbbo93Vm7",
      "fileName": "Aceasta mi-e dorinta sa Te-onorez.txt",
      "contentHash": "418384"
    }
  ],
  "updatedOn": "2024-04-09-17:18:05"
}
```

3. The upload will check the previous deployments (previous `manifest.json` files) and will upload only the new files.
   If there is no previous deployment, all files will be uploaded.

4. In order to sync the files with the GDrive, you can use the you can use the `sync-via-gdrive.sh` script,
   see [this documentation](./client-sync-macos/README.md).

### Customization Options

You can customize the conversion process by adjusting the environment variables or by directly using
the `convertSongsToPP7FormatLocally` method with your own configurations:

```typescript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import { convertSongsToPP7FormatLocally } from './';
import { Presentation_CCLI } from './proto/presentation';
import { Font } from './proto/graphicsData';

dotenv.config();

const CONFIG = {
  arrangementName: 'Any arrangement name',
  ccliSettings: {
    publisher: 'Any publisher info',
    author: 'Any author info',
    copyrightYear: new Date().getFullYear(),
    album: `Any album from ${new Date().getFullYear()}`,
    songNumber: 0,
  } as Presentation_CCLI,
  fontConfig: {
    name: 'CMGSans-Regular',
    size: 58,
    family: 'CMGSans',
    bold: true,
  } as Font,
  graphicSize: {
    width: 1920,
    height: 1080,
  },
  presentationCategory: 'Any presentation category',
  refMacroId:
    'A UUID string for referencing the macro id in the first intro blank slide',
  refMacroName:
    'A macro name for referencing the macro id in the first intro blank slide',
};

convertSongsToPP7FormatLocally({
  sourceDir: process.env.LOCAL_SOURCE_DIR as string,
  baseLocalDir: process.env.LOCAL_OUT_DIR as string,
  config: CONFIG,
});
```

### The ProPresenter7 outcome

### How It Works

The `bes-propres7-migrator` leverages reverse engineering of the `ProPresenter` `protobuf` format through
the `protodump` utility for encoding and decoding presentation files. To utilize this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arkadiyt/protodump.git
go build -o protodump cmd/protodump/main.go
```

### FAQ

<details>
<summary>ðŸ“– Advanced Sequencing with BES Sequence.</summary>

A standout feature of the `bes-propres7-migrator` is its ability to intelligently create BES sequences
in `ProPresenter7`,
enhancing the presentation of songs during live events. This section explains how the BES sequence works and the
advantages it offers.

#### How BES Sequence Works

When converting songs, `the bes-propres7-migrator` not only transfers the lyrics and formatting but also smartly
organizes song sections into an efficient sequence for live presentation. Given a song with the sequence (1,c,2,c), the
migrator
constructs what is referred to as a BES sequence in `ProPresenter7`.

This BES sequence strategically references the chorus (c) only once in the `ProPresenter7` sequence setup, even though
it appears twice in the song's progression. This approach results in a sequence where the chorus is prepared to be
displayed each time it's needed, without requiring multiple entries in the sequence.

#### Benefits of BES Sequence

- **Simplicity in Navigation**: Operators can advance through the song by simply pressing the forward key, without
  needing
  to remember the song's order or manually navigate back to the chorus. This is especially useful in live settings where
  attention and timing are critical.
- **Efficiency in Presentation**: Reduces the clutter and complexity of the song's visual presentation, making it easier
  for
  the audience to follow along.
- **Optimized Performance**: Minimizes the cognitive load on the person controlling the presentation, allowing them to
  focus
  more on the event's flow and less on the technical aspects of the presentation software.
- **Implementation**
  When utilizing the `convertSongsToPP7FormatLocally` method, the migrator automatically analyzes the song's sequence
  and applies the BES sequence logic. There's no need for manual setup or additional configuration to enable this
  feature.
  This automated process ensures your songs are ready for efficient and effective presentation with minimal effort on
  your part.

#### Example

For a song with a specified sequence of (1,c,2,c), the migrator creates a sequence in `ProPresenter7` that smartly
incorporates the chorus to appear at the correct intervals, optimizing both the operator's experience and the audience's
engagement.

<summary>ðŸ“– Initial Setup Slide with Macro Reference</summary>

An innovative feature of the `bes-propres7-migrator` is the automatic inclusion of an initial setup slide in every
exported file. This first slide is intentionally left empty and contains a reference to a predefined macro. The purpose
of this slide is to facilitate the seamless preparation of the presentation environment before the actual song content
is displayed.

#### Purpose and Benefits

- **Environment Preparation**: The macro referenced in the first slide is designed to automate the setup process for
  your live event presentation. This includes clearing previous settings, configuring the appropriate audience and stage
  layouts, setting clocks, backgrounds, and other necessary adjustments.
- **Efficiency and Consistency**: By automating the setup process, this feature ensures that all songs start with a
  consistent
  environment, reducing manual setup errors and saving time during live events.
- **Seamless Transition into Content**: Since every song starts from the second slide, the initial setup slide ensures
  that all preliminary adjustments are made without displaying unnecessary content to the audience, leading to a
  smoother transition and a more professional presentation.

- #### How to Use
  The initial setup slide is included automatically with every song conversion. To customize the actions performed by
  the referenced macro, you may need to edit the macro settings within `ProPresenter7` according to your event's
  specific requirements. This customization allows you to tailor the environment setup process to match the unique needs
  of your presentation.
